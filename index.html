     <h2>Xanthi</h2>
     <p>Hi, I live in Arizona with my handsome husband. The weather is nice here most of the time.
     Every August and September we get monsoons. Winter and spring is perfect.</p>
     <p>I have been a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for 9 years. 
     I love the confidence and bravery that I have learned from the teachings of Jesus Christ.</p>
     <p>I work in big corporate law as a paralegal. Before corporate law I was working in a large law firm.
     I plan on going to law school and becoming an Attorney. I am also taking computer programming classes at Harvard University right now.
     I really like developing, and programming.</p>
     <p>I look forward to getting to know evryone here. Thank you so much for your time.</p>
